#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 3

A reviews app where users can browse restaurants by cuisine and neighborhood. The app has offline capabilities. A restaurant can be toggled favorite even when offline and this action is synced when back online. The same goes for reviews. A user can post a review while offline (this is visible only for the user with indexed db) and the review will sync with the server when online.
