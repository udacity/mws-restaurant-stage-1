## Getting Started

### Development local API Server
_Location of server = /server_
Server depends on [node.js LTS Version: v6.11.2 ](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), and [sails.js](http://sailsjs.com/)
Please make sure you have these installed before proceeding forward.

Great, you are ready to proceed forward; awesome!

Let's start with running commands in your terminal, known as command line interface (CLI)

###### Install project dependancies
```Install project dependancies
# npm i
```
###### Install Sails.js globally
```Install sails global
# npm i sails -g
```
###### Start the server
```Start server
# node server
```
### You should now have access to your API server environment
debug: Environment : development
debug: Port        : 1337
