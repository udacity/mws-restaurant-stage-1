Return an array of\nthe raw word forms along the way including the raw word form of the supplied\n`key`.\n\nStop when the traversal hits a terminal entry or when limit words have been\ngenerated if limit is specified.\n\n.respond(text, limit)\n---------------------\n\nSearch for a starting key in `text` and then call `.fill(key, limit)` on it.\n",
